We live in a new two-storied house. There is a large garden near our house. Vegetables and fruits grow 
in the garden. We have many apple trees, raspberries, and strawberries, currants. Our house was built by my grandfather 
many years ago. It is made of wood and looks very nice.
Life in a village is different from life in the noisy city. Everything is very simple here. We have no public transport;
everyone walks on foot or rides a bike. And nobody complains about it. It seems that time is slower here than in the city. 
Nobody is in a hurry. There is not a great number of people here, everyone knows each other, greets and smiles. The rural inhabitants are rather quiet and friendly.
Our mother is a housewife and runs our household. She worked as a nurse in the town hospital earlier. Now she always has a lot 
of work in the house and in the garden. Our father works in a town near our village and helps her only at the weekends.
At the weekend, my dad, sister and I go to the town and buy everything we need for the next week. We usually buy beef, chicken, 
pork, fish, sausage, butter, oil, pasta, flour, sugar and cheese. We rarely buy fruits and vegetables because we have a lot of them in our garden.
They are very delicious. In the village there are three small stores where you can go shopping. During the week my sister or I go out and buy necessary goods there.
